  <p>
    Feed+ is a sample app that allows you to create an RSS feed of public Google+ activites and quickly add
    it to your Google Reader account. It was created using Google Apps Script, and demonstrates the usage
    of the HtmlService, ContentService, ScriptDb, and the Google+ API.
  </p>
  <p>This app currently supports creating a feed from specific user or set of search results. Please note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The RSS feeds can only contain public Google+ activities. This means it's not possible to create a feed of private or limited access activities.</li>
    <li>The RSS feeds you create are public, and anyone who has access to the URL could see the feed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To access your circles, private data, or to post to Google+ please use the web interface at <a href="https://plus.google.com">https://plus.google.com</a>.</p>
